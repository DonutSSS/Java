## Hashing
The goal for this homework will be to write an equals and hashCode method for the SimpleOomage and ComplexOomage class. For a perfect
hash function, we would expect that all the items in hash table would be spread evenly. We will implement a hash function in this homework
to make items spread out nicely. The hashTable visualizer will help us to see where the item actually locate in the table.
