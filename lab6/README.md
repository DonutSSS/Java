### Weighted Union Find with Path Compression
In this project, I implemented the union-find (a.k.a. disjoint sets) data structure using the weighted union find along with
path compression to optimize both union() and find() methods. For more information, you can refer to [Disjoint-set data structure](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure) on wikipedia.
