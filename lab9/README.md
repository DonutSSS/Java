### Trie Set
In this lab, I implement a set of Strings using another type of data structure called trie. When handling strings with ASCII encoding,
one can take advantage of an indexed array to represent a corresponding character. Using trie set, we can easily solve two common problems
called keys with prefix and longest common prefix of a string.
1. Keys with prefix: return a list of strings in the set with a common prefix;
2. Longest common prefix of a string: given a query string, return the longest common prefix in the set.
