### Build your universe!
This is the first project of UCB cs61b, see the reference link here: [NBody Simulation](https://sp19.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj0/proj0#collecting-all-needed-input)
<br>
<br>
Basically, this project is focusing on building a planet-animation image using Java. The whole programm obeys the laws of Newtonian physics. Most of the Java scripts
are designed for checking methods in Body.java and NBody.java.
<br>
<br>
Acutally, Body.java will construct objects (i.e. planets in this project) with position and velocity information. NBody.java is used for computing
updated positions after being acted by net force from other planets for a given time interval.
<br>
<br>
There are a lot of interesting .txt files to build any "planetary systems" you like. Just clone the whole repository and simply run "java T dt ./data/xxx.txt".
T and dt can be any positive doubles, xxx.txt can be any files in the data folder.

Have fun!
