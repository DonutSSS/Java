### Sound Synthesis
This is definitely an interesting project in java! (make sure your sound is on!) In this homework, I first implement a Bounded Queue
interface. After that, an ArrayStringBuffer class is constructed using built-in array data structure in java and generate 
GuitarString (and DrumString) by implementing [Karplus-Strong algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karplus%E2%80%93Strong_string_synthesis)
to synthesize guitar and drum sound. Try to run TTFAF.java to listen the amazing generated guitar song by your computer
(You can also try to uncomment some lines in TTFAF.java, by which it will play any .mid file in your folder). Have fun!
