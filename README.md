# Algorithms and Data Structures in Java


This is a Java data structure and algorithm course of UC Berkeley which contains tons of homework, labs, and projects. This repo records my solutions to every task for this course. You can refer to
different topics in seperate folders in this repo.

For more information about homework/lab/project requirements and statements, please see below.

### CS61B Homeworks
These are my solutions to UC Berkeley CS61B homeworks.
1. Homework 1: [Java Syntax and Sound Synthesis](https://sp19.datastructur.es/materials/hw/hw1/hw1)
2. Homework 2: [Percolation](https://sp19.datastructur.es/materials/hw/hw2/hw2)
3. Homework 3: [Hashing](https://sp19.datastructur.es/materials/hw/hw3/hw3)
4. Homework 4: [Puzzle Solver](https://sp19.datastructur.es/materials/hw/hw4/hw4)

### CS61B Projects
These are my solutions to UC Berkeley CS61B projects.

1. Project 0: [NBody Simulation](https://sp19.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj0/proj0)
2. Project 1A: [Data Structures](https://sp19.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj1a/proj1a), specifically, constructing deque using linked
lists and arrays.
3. Project 1B:  [Applying and Testing Data Structures](https://sp19.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj1b/proj1b)
4. Project 2AB: [Extrinsic PQ and KDTree](https://sp19.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj2ab/proj2ab)
5. Project 2C: [Bear Maps](https://sp19.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj2c/proj2c)
6. Project 3: [BYoW](https://sp19.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj3/proj3)
