### Debugging and Testing
The goal for this lab is getting familar with JUnit in Intellij IDE to quickly debug and test methods. By constructing different tests
for multiple java class in this lab, I grasped how to write valid tests using JUnit API. Based on such Test-Driven Development (TDD)
process, I implemented two methods to reverse a linked list (iteration vs. recursion), and get a better understanding of difference
between "==" an .equals() in Java.
