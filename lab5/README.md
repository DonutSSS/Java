### Hug Life
In this lab, we are creating creatures and simulating their interactions. In the HugLife.java file, if we run this file with argument 
"samplesolo" (i.e. run $ java HugLife.java samplesolo in your terminal), we will see our world open with a lonely red square wandering 
around randomly. The first creature created is Plips, which are lazy (but motile) photosynthesizing creatures. They mostly just stand 
around and grow and replicate, but theyâ€™ll flee if they happen to see their mortal enemy, the Clorus, our second creature. (try to run
$ java HugLife.java sampleplip). Finally, if everything goes smoothly, we'll see two creates interact with each other [in an interesting
way](http://i.imgur.com/E2Kdowq.gifv). To test the java file actually works, try to run $ java HugLife.java strugggz.
