### Interger Linked List
This part is focusing on linked list (integer type) data structure in Java. In IntList.java, I implemented several methods to square every
entries in the list and concatenate two lists. (Tried iterative vs. recursive as well as destrutive vs non-destructive). IntListTest.java is
designed to test each method actually works well.
