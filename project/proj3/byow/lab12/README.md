## Draw Hex World
This lab will be helpful to familiarize you with important libraries including our Tile Rendering engine in real project 3, 
and also help you think about how you can take complex drawing tasks and break them into simpler pieces

The ultimate goal is to create a random terrain generator that will build hexagon based worlds. As an example, the world below contains 
fields of grass, fields of flowers, deserts, forests, and mountains. Besides, the hex world generator should be able to support 
differently sized hexagons as well. The pictures below show random hex worlds consisting of size-2, size-3 and size-4 hexagons, 
respectively.
